# Youtube_harvesting
## Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis of YouTube channel and video data using Python, PostgreSQL, and Streamlit. The goal was to retrieve data from the YouTube API, store it in a PostgreSQL database, and present the data through an interactive web application using Streamlit. This project demonstrates my understanding and application of API integration, data manipulation, database management, and building a web-based dashboard.

## Key Features
Channel Details: Displays detailed information about a specified YouTube channel, including the number of subscribers, views, and total videos.
Video Details: Lists all videos from the specified channel along with their respective statistics like views, likes, and comments.
Comment Details: Provides insights into comments made on each video.
SQL Query Execution: Allows users to execute predefined SQL queries to extract specific insights from the data.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive learning experience in various aspects of software development, including API interaction, data manipulation, database management, and web application development. It serves as a practical demonstration of how to build an end-to-end data analysis application, from data collection to presentation.
